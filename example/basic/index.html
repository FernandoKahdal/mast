			Stylesheets
			==============================

			You know the drill- just some stylesheets
		-->

	<body>

		<!--
			Main content region
			========================

			Notice that we default the region's contents 
			to the `Body` template directly in the HTML
		-->
		<region template="Body"></region>



		<!--
			HTML Templates
			========================

			HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
			To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and *this one* expect 
			you to load these bits of HTML client-side.

			Each template HTML file corresponds to a specific UI component, which is then rendered
			by the framework.

			In this case, we're using JST to precompile our templates into JavaScript functions.
			This not only makes them render faster, but also allows us to fetch them using a simple 
			script tag, which is perfect for the purposes of our demo.
		-->
		<script type="text/javascript" src="jst.js"></script>
		


		<!--
			JS Dependencies
			========================
			
			Get the framework itself, plus any other JavaScript dependencies
		-->
		<script src="linker/js/mast.dev.js"></script>


		<!--
			Components
			========================

			Components are JavaScript modules which add interactivity via simple, declarative-wherever-possible bindings.
			Each component is tied to a specific same-named template in the DOM
			( e.g. the component `Body.js` matches the template with `data-id="Body"` )

			Components can control any regions located inside of their template, as well as listening for the following:
				+ global app events ( e.g. '%logout' )
				+ DOM events on the template element or its descendants ( e.g. 'click .button' )
				+ the `hashchange` event; i.e. changes to the hash/fragment in the URL ( e.g. '#about_us' )

		<!--
			Start Up Framework
			========================

			This section will be unnecessary soon, since the framework will be started automatically by default
			(like jQuery)

			If you need to wait to start up the framework, call Framework.pause() as soon as possible.  
			To allow the framework to finish loading, call Framework.resume( [cb] ).
			(roughly equivalent to http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.holdReady/)
		-->
		<script>
			// Set the log level to `debug` so we can see what's going on
			Mast.logLevel = 'debug';

			// Start framework
			Mast.raise();
		</script>
