# Mast

### What is Mast?

Productivity-enhancing front-end library based on Backbone.js.  Mast takes standard conventions you use in every Backbone project and formalizes them.  

There are 1,000 ways to build a jQuery script.  There are 100 ways to build a Backbone app.  Mast takes it to the next level, providing standard conventions for DOM development.  It was built from the ground up for creating realtime web applications that work with handsets, tablets, and PC browers.  Like Sails, Mast is a collection of the latest stable versions of really great libraries, in this case Backbone.js, jQuery, and Socket.io.


### Why Bother?
With Mast, building the front-end for your app is *faster*, *"funner"* and requires *fewer* lines of code.


## How It Works
At its core, Mast is made up of Components, Models, and Collections.  Components are very closely related to Backbone Views, and Models and Collections are exactly like their Backbone equivalents.

Mast introduces the concept of a Component, which is a minimal logical UI element which completely abstracts DOM templating. 
When you change the model, or change the template, for a component, it just works-- the screen automatically gets updated.

Mast also enhances jQuery's DOM events by adding "pressEnter", "pressEscape", and "clickoutside", as well as providing access to global events, like $(window).scroll, from the events hash (no more worrying about whether the element you're binding to has focus or not!).
